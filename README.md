This is a PDF-Reader prototype made with Gradio. 

To start, you will need a HuggingFace API Token (https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens).

You will need to create a ```.env``` file to include your ```HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN```. <br />

```HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN='YOUR ACCESS TOKEN'```

For now, the model can be tested with ```gradio app.py```
